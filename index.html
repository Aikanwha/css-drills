            <h2>The Chrysalids</h2>
            <p>The inhabitants of post-apocalypse Labrador have vague knowledge of the "Old People", a technologically
                advanced civilization they believe was destroyed when God sent "Tribulation" to the world to punish
                their forebears' sins. The inhabitants practise a form of fundamentalist Christianity; they believe that
                to follow God's word and prevent another Tribulation, they must preserve absolute normality among the
                surviving humans, plants and animals, and therefore practice eugenics. Humans with even minor mutations
                are considered blasphemies and either killed or sterilized and banished to the Fringes, a lawless and
                <span>untamed</span> area rife with animal and plant mutations, and suggested to be contaminated with radiation.
                Arguments occur over the keeping of a tailless cat or the possession of over-sized horses. These are
                deemed by the government to be legitimate breeds, either existing before or achieved through
                conventional breeding. The government's position is considered both cynical and heretical by many of the
                orthodox frontier community, and it is suggested that they support the usage of these animals for the
                sole purpose of their greater efficiency.</p>
